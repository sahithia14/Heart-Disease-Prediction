Heart Disease Diagnois using Machine Learning and Deep Learning


This data set is from the UCI Machine Learning library and it can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease 

Description: 

This data set currently contains 303 instances, some of which aren't complete (some features may be missing for a certain instance). In the case that this happens, the instance has been removed. There are 14 relevant features which have been extracted, from a maximum of 76 in the total dataset. 

The target variable is feature # 14, which represents any narrowing in any major blood vessel due to cholesterol and plaque deposits, as detected through the use of an angiogram. This is a key indicator of heart disease, and can be used as the basis for prediction.  More information about coronary heart disease can be found here: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613

Feature #14 has also been reduced to a binary problem to detect the presence of any vessel narrowing; the levels of severity will not be the main goal of this specifc project 

Results:

tried various deep learning and machine learning models, and the deep learning keras sequential model proved to have the highest accuracy.
